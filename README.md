# ScriptLibrary
My personal library of scripts I have used over the course of my studies and work.

## AWS Provisioning
- This directory includes setting up usergroups and security groups in AWS. 
- Inside you can also find the scripts to provision an EC2 AWS server
- and Jenkins setup inside of the cicd directory
